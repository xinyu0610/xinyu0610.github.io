I am a first-year doctoral student in the [School of Information Management](https://ischool.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/) under the guidance of [Prof. Yonghe Lu](https://ischool.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans/teacher/luyonghe). 

My passion for information has led me to specialize in text semantic analysis, document information extraction and organization, and knowledge graph research. These areas have the potential to revolutionize how we understand, manage, and access information in the digital age.

We constructed a large-scale Chinese patent dataset (CNPatents) and used the first four digits of IPC classification numbers as
labels. Then, we utilized BERT, RoBERTa, and RBT3 models for training and testing. For our classification task with more than 600 labels, the best model reached an accuracy of 75.6% and a Micro-F1 value of 59.7%. After high-frequency label screening, the accuracy and the Micro-F1 value increased to 91.2% and 71.7%. The patent documents as the training set have extreme data imbalance issues, which need more research to improve the high-frequency tag screening for the training. This paper realizes the automatic classification of multi-label patents and further improves the performance of the classification model with high-frequency label screening.
