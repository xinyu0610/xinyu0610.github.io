We constructed a pharmaceutical entity recognition model based on Attention-BiLSTM-CRF and examined it on the public datasets of GENIA Term Annotation Task and BioCreative II Gene Mention Tagging. We also used the model to annotate abstracts of biomedical scientific papers. The F1 values of our model on the two data sets were 81.57% and 84.23%, while the accuracy rates were 92.51% and 97.85%. These results are better than those of the benchmark ones. Moreover, our model has more advantages in processing extremely unbalanced data. The volume of data and application of entity labeling experiments are relatively homogeneous. The proposed model improves the effectiveness of entity recognition and the mining of new medical knowledge.
